I"<h3>Part I: Framework</h3>

<p>The process of working with data draws many parallels with the design process. While data can make up the research subset of the design process, the process of collecting, analyzing and understanding data can be creatively generative too. I wanted to adopt this process into my project as a starting off point. I converted the data science process I had learned from a previous class into a framework statement.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><b>Data Framework</b></p>
<div class="proj-white-box">

<p>To discover more about [subject], <span class="italic-serif"> what do you want to know more about?</span></p>


<p>I will track [variable / aspect] <span class="italic-serif"> what aspects or variables (can be more than one) will you be tracking in order to learn more about your subject?</span></p>

<p>using [medium / units] <span class="italic-serif">how will these aspects or variables be measured? (quantitative or qualitative)</span></p>


<p>for [amount of time]. <span class="italic-serif">how long will you be tracking these variables in order to get a good understanding of your subject?</span></p>

</div>

<p><br /></p>

<p><b>Examples of the framework statement in action:</b></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>To discover more about my mental health, I will track my mood using doodles for a week.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>To discover more about friendships, I will track our communication using number of texts sent for a day.</p>

<p><br />
To feel more in sync with myself and friends, I will track our lives using events and moods for a year.</p>

<p><br />
This framework will help me ideate on how I wanted to approach my project‚ÄîThe project is aimed at helping people feel more connected to others while being physically apart, but what pieces of data would people most want to know about their friends and family? How would I present this data? How many variables or aspects should I be tracking to make the insights meaningful but at the same time accessible for my busy audience?</p>

<h3>Part II: Audience Role</h3>

<p>Another pertinent part of the experience to be considered is the role of my audience and how they would be experiencing the app. Here were the main roles I considered for my audience:</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>ü§ñ Passive role</h4>
<p>The app would collect the information from the audiences‚Äô phone usage and other internet of things devices. With the information collected, the app algorithms would automatically analyze the data and visually output a visualization and summary of that data. In this role, the user is passively discovering their habits.</p>

<p>Pros:
Least amount of work for the audience
Accessible in terms of ease of use, least time consuming</p>

<p>Cons:
May be least engaging
Audience may not fully understand what factors / aspects were taken in account when creating the visualizations or summary
By limiting the factors / aspects to those that can be tracked by internet of things devices, the insights may be sterile and lacking a human quality to it</p>

<p>üèÉ Active Role
An active role will have the audience manually input their own data. The data will be represented using the app‚Äôs predefined visual language. From the visualizations, the audience can draw their own conclusions, but brief summaries can also be offered by the app.</p>

<p>Pros:
Allows the audience to collect their own data. Gives them the control to decide what they will collect and will not collect. By doing so, they will be able to notice things on a higher level of awareness.
WIth a predefined visual language, it relieves the audience of having to come up with how they will represent the data</p>

<p>Cons:
Requires a bit more work on the part of the audience</p>

<p>üßë‚Äçüé® Creative Role
A creative role gives the audience the freedom to decide on what they want to track as it pertains to the subject and how they will represent it visually. It will heavily rely on the framework statement created to help anchor the audience.</p>

<p>Pros:
It can generate some surprising and creative visualizations.
It gives the widest range of possibilities in terms of what to track, how to track and how it is presented.</p>

<p>Cons:
Requires the most work on the part of the audience
May not be ideal in the format of an app because it limits how data can be represented to digital forms</p>
