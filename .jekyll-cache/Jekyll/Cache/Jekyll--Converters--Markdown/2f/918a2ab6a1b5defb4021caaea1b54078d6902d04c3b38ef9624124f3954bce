To better understand my audience, I conducted a google form survey and one on one interviews. Below is my team map which shows an overview of people who have assisted me on my project. They are divided into 3 categories: audience, strategy and inspiration.

<h3>Connections in Isolation  Survey</h3>

<ul>

<li>My audience mostly communicate to each other digitally: text message, calling, video calling and social media (top 4 ways)</li>

<li>Weekday evenings are the most popular time for friends and family to spend time together.</li>
<li>A majority of people alot 2â€“4+hours towards spending time with others at one time.</li>
<li>During the pandemic, most people have sought out digital solutions to hanging out such as: video games, virtual game / movie nights and long phone calls. There are a few more in person ways people have done which include dropping things off at each otherâ€™s places.</li>
<li>People miss the mundane things they use to be able to do such as running to people in public, seeing each otherâ€™s smiles, and being able to eat out.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="article">Strategy</h2>

<h3>Audience</h3>
<ul class="override">
<li>They are busy people with work, school or familial commitments.</li>
<li>Time and schedule differences prevent people from directly communicating. Their responses are often delayed and can become water-down when a long time has elapsed.</li>
    
<li>They use their phones as primary means of direct communication with their friends and family. They enjoy it for its ease and instantaneous response.</li>
<li>They care most about how their friends and family are doing (mental and physical wellbeing) and any life updates they may have.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Fish McGill</h3>

<ul>
<li>It is also about the connections we create with others through the data.</li>

<li>We should aim for deep insights and accessibility.</li>
<li>Viewer needs effort and patience to decipher and take in the data. This act is akin to listening to someone.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Mayuri Saxena</h3>
<ul>
<li>Start by observing yourself and your own data</li>
<li>Her own project to create data projects and to spark connections and conversations between strangers was inspiring.</li>
<li>Take account of the different personalities of your audience</li>
</ul>


<h3>Nathalie Miebach</h3>
<ul>
<li>Data is a medium, what are the different ways you can treat and present it? What other senses can you evoke?</li>
<li>Work with the data and the medium simultaneously. Experiment around with both.</li>
<li>Invoke play first. Let them discover that it is data as they experience it.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Martha Rettig</h3>
<ul>
<li>What are the other modes of communication can you tap into? Is there a tangible physical solution as well?</li>
<li>Choose mediums that would be most accessible to your audience and that would allow your audience to easily collect data. Make the process of collecting data rewarding and satisfying.</li>
<li>One to two weeks of data collection is a good amount to draw insights from without being too monotonous.</li>
</ul>
