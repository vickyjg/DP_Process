<h4>Connections in Isolation Survey</h4>

<ul>
  <li>My audience mostly communicate to each other digitally: text message, calling, video calling and social media (top 4 ways)</li>

  <li>A majority of people alot 2â€“4+hours towards spending time with others at one time.</li>
  <li>During the pandemic, most people have sought out digital solutions to hanging out such as: video games, virtual game / movie nights and long phone calls. There are a few more in person ways people have done which include dropping things off at each otherâ€™s places.</li>
  <li>People miss the mundane things they use to be able to do such as running to people in public, seeing each otherâ€™s smiles, and being able to eat out.</li>
</ul>

<h4>One on One Audience Interviews</h4>
<ul>
  <li>They are busy people with work, school or familial commitments.</li>
  <li>Time and schedule differences prevent people from directly communicating. Their responses are often delayed and can become water-down when a long time has elapsed.</li>
  <li>They use their phones as primary means of direct communication with their friends and family. They enjoy it for its ease and instantaneous response.</li>
  <li>They care most about how their friends and family are doing (mental and physical wellbeing) and any life updates they may have.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Fish McGill</h4>

</ul>

</ul>

<h4>Nathalie Miebach</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Data is a medium, what are the different ways you can treat and present it? What other senses can you evoke?</li>
  <li>Work with the data and the medium simultaneously. Experiment around with both.</li>
  <li>Invoke play first. Let them discover that it is data as they experience it.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Martha Rettig</h4>
<ul>
  <li>What are the other modes of communication can you tap into? Is there a tangible physical solution as well?</li>
  <li>Choose mediums that would be most accessible to your audience and that would allow your audience to easily collect data. Make the process of collecting data rewarding and satisfying.</li>
  <li>One to two weeks of data collection is a good amount to draw insights from without being too monotonous.</li>
</ul>
