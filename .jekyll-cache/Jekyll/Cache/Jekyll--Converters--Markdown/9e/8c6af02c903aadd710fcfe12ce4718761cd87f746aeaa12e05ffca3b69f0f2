<p><q>How can data encourage self discovery and connections with our inner circles when we are physically apart?</q></p>

<p>This past year, our lives have been uprooted in every sense from large scale institutional changes to the small scale changes. Our habits and rituals we have hone in on have been disrupted. In varying degrees, we have all had to isolate ourselves, giving us copious amounts of time to reflect on ourselves and the world around us. While this time to reflect by oneself can be cherished, on the other hand, we have an innate need as humans to connect. More than ever, people need each other’s support. But how does one begin to approach that when one of the major avenues for support and connection—gathering—is restricted?</p>

<p>My project originally started as a project of how data can be used as a tool for self-discovery and finding our own narratives. However, as I examined my inspirations for the project, I realized that the projects were as much as about self-discovery as it was about sharing and making connections to others with those discoveries. It is a two-fold goal and the process actually lends itself to it befittingly. The individual gathers data and information about themselves. They analyze the data and draw their own conclusions. They share these conclusions with others; thus, sharing their perspective and pieces of themselves to others.</p>

<p>I have personally felt this frustration. My friends and I mutually apologize after weeks of noncommunication because we were too busy caught up in work or school. When we finally have the chance to actually talk and catch up, it is either the same remarks about life or watered down versions of events.</p>

<p>Drawing from my own experiences and those close around me, I’ve decided to narrow the scope of the project to the context and audience:
The target audience are people who are looking to reconnect with their friends and families. They may not be able to reconnect to the extent they would like to due to constraints of time and physical distance. My audience are busy; they have work, school or familial commitments. The people who they want to connect with are far away, whether that is due to social distancing or merely living in distant places.</p>

<p>Is there a way to set up structured activity or time where these connections can be strengthened? In this sense, I look to other ways people have connected during the pandemic or to distant people. People have employed a wide variety of communication: some more analog such as the humble letter to the digital with the rise of Zoom video calling. For the approach, I imagine it to be in the form of an app which will provide instantaneous communication and will be accessible to a wide audience.</p>

<p>As we have seen during the pandemic, people have a great propensity to seek solutions with such limits. What has amazed me is the sheer ingenuity and creativity of people to cope and create. I am hoping to create an experience using data to foster these deeper connections despite these constraints.</p>
