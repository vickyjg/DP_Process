<h4>Survey</h4>
<ul>
  <li>My audience mostly communicate to each other digitally: text message, calling, video calling and social media (top 4 ways)</li>

  <li>A majority of people alot 2â€“4+hours towards spending time with others at one time.</li>
  <li>During the pandemic, most people have sought out digital solutions to hanging out such as: video games, virtual game / movie nights and long phone calls. There are a few more in person ways people have done which include dropping things off at each otherâ€™s places.</li>
  <li>People miss the mundane things they use to be able to do such as running to people in public, seeing each otherâ€™s smiles, and being able to eat out.</li>
</ul>

<h4>One on One Interviews</h4>
<ul>
  <li>They are busy people with work, school or familial commitments.</li>
  <li>Time and schedule differences prevent people from directly communicating. Their responses are often delayed and can become water-down when a long time has elapsed.</li>

  <li>They care most about how their friends and family are doing (mental and physical wellbeing) and any life updates they may have.</li>
