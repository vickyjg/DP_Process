I"ª<p>After meeting with my advisor, Fish, and looking back at my inspirations, I realized the direction I wanted to go into was as much about self-discovery as it was about creating connections between people using those discoveries.</p>

<p>It is as much about self discovery as it is about fostering connections with others.</p>
