I"ä<p>The process of working with data draws many parallels with the design process. While data can make up the research subset of the design process, the process of collecting, analyzing and understanding data can be creatively generative too. I wanted to adopt this process into my project as a starting off point. I converted the data science process I had learned from a previous class into a framework statement.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><b>Data Framework</b></p>
<div class="proj-white-box">

<p>To discover more about [subject], <span class="italic-serif"> what do you want to know more about?</span></p>


<p>I will track [variable / aspect] <span class="italic-serif"> what aspects or variables (can be more than one) will you be tracking in order to learn more about your subject?</span></p>

<p>using [medium / units] <span class="italic-serif">how will these aspects or variables be measured? (quantitative or qualitative)</span></p>


<p>for [amount of time]. <span class="italic-serif">how long will you be tracking these variables in order to get a good understanding of your subject?</span></p>

</div>

<p><br /></p>

<p><b>Examples of the framework statement in action:</b></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>To discover more about my mental health, I will track my mood using doodles for a week.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>To discover more about friendships, I will track our communication using number of texts sent for a day.</p>

<p><br />
To feel more in sync with myself and friends, I will track our lives using events and moods for a year.</p>

<p><br />
This framework will help me ideate on how I wanted to approach my projectâ€”The project is aimed at helping people feel more connected to others while being physically apart, but what pieces of data would people most want to know about their friends and family? How would I present this data? How many variables or aspects should I be tracking to make the insights meaningful but at the same time accessible for my busy audience?</p>
