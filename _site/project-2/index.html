                    <p>After meeting with my advisor, Fish, and looking back at my inspirations, I realized the direction I wanted to go into was <b>as much about self-discovery as it was about creating connections between people</b> using those discoveries.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>In addition, Mayuri Saxena who talked to me about her project, Friendshipments, gave me advice to first observe myself. I took time to look into it and surfaced what mattered to me the most. I revised my statement and researchable question to be reflective of my new goals.</p>

<p>In addition, Mayuri Saxena who talked to me about her project, Friendshipments, gave me advice to first observe myself. 
I took time to look into it and surfaced what mattered to me the most. I revised my statement and researchable question to be reflective of my new goals.</p>

<h3>Revised Question</h3>

<p>My researchable question pivoted from:</p>

<div class="side-by-side-change">
<p class="side-by-side-change-component">
    How can our own data from day to day experiences be used to encourage self discovery and explore the multiplicity of our narratives?</p>

<p class="side-by-side-change-component"><i>to</i></p>

<p class="side-by-side-change-component">How can data encourage self discovery and connections with our inner circles when we are physically apart?</p>

</div>

<h3>Audience</h3>

<p>Busy people who want to feel more connected with their friends and family</p>

<h3>Context</h3>

<p>Structured communal activity with an analog and
digital component</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Is there a way to set up structured activity or time where these connections can be strengthened? In this sense, I look to other ways people have connected during the pandemic or to distant people. People have employed a wide variety
of communication: some more analog such as the humble letter to the digital with the rise of Zoom video calling.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>For my approach, I plan to use a combination of the twoâ€”perhaps an analog activity to evoke the feeling of being physically present along with technology which will provide more instantaneous communication. I also want the flexibility of the activity to be asynchronous or synchronous to accommodate for different schedules.</p>
