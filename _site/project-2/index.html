<section id="one" class="section">

<p>After meeting with my advisor, Fish, and looking back at my inspirations, I realized the direction I wanted to go into was <b>as much about self-discovery as it was about creating connections between people</b> using those discoveries.</p>


<p>In addition, Mayuri Saxena who talked to me about her project, Friendshipments, gave me advice to first observe myself. I took time to look into it and surfaced what mattered to me the most. I revised my statement and researchable question to be reflective of my new goals.</p>


</section>

<section id="two" class="section">
    
<h2>Revised Question</h2>

<p>My researchable question pivoted from:</p>

<div class="side-by-side-change">
<p class="side-by-side-change-component">
    How can our own data from day to day experiences be used to encourage self discovery and explore the multiplicity of our narratives?</p>

<p class="side-by-side-change-component"><i>to</i></p>

<p class="side-by-side-change-component">How can data encourage self discovery and connections with our inner circles when we are physically apart?</p>

</div>

</section>


<section id="three" class="section">
<h2>Audience</h2>

<b>Busy people who want to feel more connected with their friends and family</b>
<p>My personal experiences inspired my audience. With the pandemic, my friends, family and I have not met up to the same extent we would have normally. We've also become increasingly busy in our work; many of us recently got full-time jobs and have family commitments. It left us little time and energy to catch up. When we do eventually get the chance to catch up, it is usually the same remarks about life or watered down version of events.</p>

</section>

<section id="four" class="section">
<h2>Context</h2>

<p>Is there a way to set up structured activity or time where these connections can be strengthened? In this sense, I look to other ways people have connected during the pandemic or to distant people. People have employed a wide variety of communication: some more analog such as the humble letter to the digital with the rise of Zoom video calling.</p>


<p>For my approach, I had originally planned to use a combination of the twoâ€”perhaps an analog activity to evoke the feeling of being physically present along with technology which will provide more instantaneous communication. I also want the flexibility of the activity to be asynchronous or synchronous to accommodate for different schedules.</p>

<section id="five" class="section">
<h2>Scope</h2>

<figcaption>Scope diagram with accessibility and insight level axes</figcaption>

<p>We are aiming for accessible and deep insights. By accessible, I mean it makes data easier to comprehend and interact with for a wider audience who may not be experienced in it. Deep insights can be defined as pieces of information that the audience finds valuable in knowing about a person and can foster a connection between people.</p>
