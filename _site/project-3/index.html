To better understand my audience, I conducted a google form survey and one on one interviews. Below is my team map which shows an overview of people who have assisted me on my project. They are divided into 3 categories: audience, strategy and inspiration.

<h2 class="article">Connections in Isolation  Survey</h2>


* My audience mostly communicate to each other digitally: text message, calling, video calling and social media (top 4 ways)
* People tend to spend time together largely by gathering and having a meal.
Weekday evenings are the most popular time for friends and family to spend time together.
* A majority of people alot 2–4+hours towards spending time with others at one time.
* During the pandemic, most people have sought out digital solutions to hanging out such as: video games, virtual game / movie nights and long phone calls. There are a few more in person ways people have done which include dropping things off at each other’s places.
* People miss the mundane things they use to be able to do such as running to people in public, seeing each other’s smiles, and being able to eat out.

<h2 class="article">One on One Interviews</h2>

* They are busy people with work, school or familial commitments.
* Time and schedule differences prevent people from directly communicating. Their responses are often delayed and can become water-down when a long time has elapsed.
* They use their phones as primary means of direct communication with their friends and family. They enjoy it for its ease and instantaneous response.
* They care most about how their friends and family are doing (mental and physical wellbeing) and any life updates they may have.

<h4>Fish McGill</h4>
* It is also about the connections we create with others through the data.
* We should aim for deep insights and accessibility.
* Viewer needs effort and patience to decipher and take in the data. This act is akin to listening to someone.

<h4>Mayuri Saxena</h4>
* Start by observing yourself and your own data
* Her own project to create data projects and to spark connections and conversations between strangers was inspiring.
* Take account of the different personalities of your audience

<h4>Nathalie Miebach</h4>
* Data is a medium, what are the different ways you can treat and present it? What other senses can you evoke?
* Work with the data and the medium simultaneously. Experiment around with both.
* Invoke play first. Let them discover that it is data as they experience it. 


<h4>Martha Rettig</h4>
* What are the other modes of communication can you tap into? Is there a tangible physical solution as well? 
* Choose mediums that would be most accessible to your audience and that would allow your audience to easily collect data. Make the process of collecting data rewarding and satisfying.
* One to two weeks of data collection is a good amount to draw insights from without being too monotonous.
