    <p>During the final few weeks before the symposium presentation, we created a poster and short video to advertise how degree projects. At that point in time, I had not finished my high fidelity prototype so my approach was to advertise with my researchable question and key visuals.</p>

    <p>My animated poster utilized the three basic shapes of a moment. The shapes represent the types of moments: event, news or thought. The animated colored dots that fade in and out represent the moods. </p>

    <h2 class="article">Promo Video</h2>

    <p>For my promotional video, I kept it simpleâ€”first conveying the problem through text messages, followed by by researchable question, then a quick explanation of data by the one and only, Giorgia Lupi, and finally the title page. All set to the anthem of this project: Happy Together by the Turtles.</p>

    <h2 class="article">Presentation</h2>
    <p>It all culminated into my presentation for symposium. In a span of 21 minutes, I went over an abbreviated version of my process and ended with my final app deliverable. The presentation overall went very well. Something that many viewers picked up on was how the project built empathy into technology and data. It was definitely one of the unwritten goals of the project so I'm glad it came across. </p>

    <h2 class="article">The Finale</h2>
    <p>I hope I did the best to create an experience for others to feel more in tune with themselves and their circles. For me, one of the best parts of the project was conducting the prototype experiment with my friends. Despite being in a prototype phase, we were still able to connect and share each other's moments. It was facilitating conversations and moments or data bonding.</p>
    
    <h3>Potential Future Iterations</h3>
    <b>> What does a shared moment look like?</b>
    <p>This project focused on moments that happened to individuals when they were apart from their circles. When we start gathering again and have those shared moments, how might that be visualized? What types of information would be essential to record for shared moments?</p>
    
    <b>> What information can be automatically collected by your device versus more consciously inputted by the individual?</b>
    <p>This question really speaks to the balance of letting the individual (or user) decide versus an algorithm. In the In Sync app, the pieces of information that were automatically collected by the device included the time and location. The information that was inputted by the user was more subjective to the individual.</p>
    <p>I think this balance is important, especially giving users the power to record things as they preceive. For example, rather than having an algorithm examine your moments' description to try to draw out your mood. You should be able to express and input how you felt. By doing this, I think it helps retain the empathetic parts of the data. Vice versa, for more objective pieces of information like time and location, those things computers can better pick up on. I would like to figure out what other pieces of information the device can pick up on to help enrich the narrative of the moment without putting more effort on the user to log those pieces of information.</p>
    
    <h3>Key Takeways</h3>
    <b>Technology as facilitators of connections</b>
    <p>I sometimes see technology, specifically social media, as substitutes for real connections and communication. For example, I can easily connect with others using instant messaging, or scrolling through instagram posts. In many ways, social media can be less than satisfying for communication and connecting. However, through my project, I really tried to emphasize technology as a complement to the real experiences of sharing moments and connecting in real life. We should not wholly get rid of one over the other, but figure out ways technology can enrich those real life connections.</p>
    
    <b>Initiate the story with data</b>
    <p>The data doesn't always speak for itself. More often than not, it's messy and complex. To understand it, we need narratives; that is where our personal stories come in. If you think back to the four types of information collected for each moment (type of moment, mood, topic, significance), these pieces of information are actually quite shallow. They are tidbits of information in comparison to the actual moment. They act as teasers to the actual story. Although shallow, I hope these small insights can spark more conversations and interactions with your inner circles.</p>
