This week after meeting with Fish and looking back at my inspirations, I realized the direction I wanted to go into was <b>as much about self-discovery as it was about creating connections between people </b> using those discoveries. 

<br> 

In addition, Mayuri Saxena who talked to me about her project, Friendshipments, gave me advice to first observe myself. 
I took time to look into it and surfaced what mattered to me the most. I revised my statement and researchable question to be reflective of my new goals.


<h3>Revised Statement</h3>
